# Project 2 - Flack

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A online messaging service website build as part of a coursework project of CS50W course based on the specifications mentioned in this page -> https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/2/project2.html

Flack is an online messaging service build using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into the site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time.
